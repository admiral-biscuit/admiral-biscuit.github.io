     University Education
    </header>
    <p><a href="/maths/hu">I studied mathematics</a> at the Humboldt University in Berlin with a focus on differential geometry. In October 2021, I finished my master's degree with a total grade of 1,3.</p>
    <p><b>Master thesis:</b> <a href="/maths/hu/jklma.pdf" class="pdf-link">Dirac Eigenvalues of Homogeneous 3-Spheres</a></p>
    <p>Before that, I completed a bachelor's teaching degree in physics and mathematics (2013 to 2016). I proceeded with the consecutive master's teaching degree as well, but I did not enjoy it at all, so I decided to not finish it and completely drop physics in favour of mathematics. <span class="comment">(This turned out to be the correct decision.)</span></p>

     Professional Experience
    </header>
    <p>I am an experienced Kotlin developer (mostly backend, sometimes frontend).</p>
    <p>My main objective is writing highly reliable, maintainable, and testable code. In order to achieve this, I place a strong focus on <b>functional programming</b> methods (e.g. <a href="https://arrow-kt.io/" class="external-link">Arrow.kt</a>) combined with a <b>compiler-driven</b> and <b>test-driven</b> developing approach.</p>
    <p>I actively engage in my company's competence center <em><q>reliablity and security</q></em> by presenting functional programming methods to my colleagues on a regular basis.</p>
    <p>Additionally, I sometimes write <a href="/dev#blog-posts">blog posts</a> about these topics.</p>
    <p>I mainly work with these technologies:</p>
    <ul>
     <li><em>Languages</em> – Kotlin (and sometimes TypeScript)</li>
     <li><em>Frameworks</em> – Spring Boot, ktor, kotest</li>
     <li><em>DevOps</em> – Docker, Kubernetes</li>
    </ul>

      Kotlin Developer – tech@spree
     </header><em>from December 2021 until now</em>
     <p>I currently work as a mid-level (a.k.a. <q>professional</q>) software developer for <b>akquinet tech@spree GmbH</b>.</p>
     <p>I help developing digital health applications in the telematics infrastructure for the <a href="https://www.gematik.de/" class="external-link">gematik</a>, such as:</p>
     <ul>
      <li>Basis Consumer <em>(offers, among other things, cryptographic operations to users of the telematics infrastructure)</em></li>
      <li>TI Messenger <em>(instant messaging service in the medical sector)</em></li>

      Student Assistant – Humboldt University
     </header><em>from October 2016 until October 2021</em>
     <p>During my mathematics studies at Humboldt University, <a href="/maths/hu#shk">I worked as a student assistant (SHK)</a> of several professors.</p>
     <p></p>
     <p>My main task was to correct homework and give tutorials for future maths teachers.</p>

     Teaching
    </header>
    <p>I enjoy teaching, which is why in addition to my full-time job as a developer, I also work as a maths teacher. <span class="comment">(The programming is for the wallet but the maths is for the heart.)</span></p>
    <p>I have been working as a substitute maths teacher since I finished school in 2013 at many different schools in Berlin.</p>
    <p>Starting from 2022, I have been leading a yearly <a href="/maths/agas">working group on algebraic structures</a> for particularly eager 10th-grade students at the <a href="https://hhgym.de/" class="external-link">Heinrich-Hertz-Gymnasium</a>, which is a special maths school in Berlin. The content of the course is at university level. <span class="comment">(Of course, we cover much less content over a much longer period of time.)</span></p>

     Publications
    </header>
    <p>At the moment I am not involved in research at all.</p>
    <p>However, I have one published paper, whose content is based on my master thesis. <span class="comment">(Since I actually managed to find out something new...)</span></p>
    <div class="heading-with-short-description">
     <b>On the Dirac Spectrum of Homogeneous 3-Spheres</b>
     <p><em>J. Geom. Analysis 32 (2022), no. 11, Paper No. 275</em></p>
     <p>The paper is freely available <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12220-022-00997-x" class="external-link">here</a>. This is joint work with my professor <a href="https://www.math.hu-berlin.de/~schueth/" class="external-link">Dorothee Schüth</a>.</p>

     Personal Interests
    </header>
    <p>Apart from maths and programming, I am interested in the following things:</p>
    <div class="heading-with-short-description">
     <b>Pets</b>
     <p>I own a Golden Retriever named <a href="/biscuit">Biscuit</a>, who is probably the most precious being to ever exist.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="heading-with-short-description">
     <b>Woodworking and Furniture-Building</b>
     <p>I despise furniture made out of pressed wood with my whole heart, which is why I acquired some basic woodworking skills over the years and build most of my furniture myself.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="heading-with-short-description">
     <b>Gardening and Landscaping</b>
     <p>I rent a garden plot (a.k.a. <q>Kleingarten</q>) in Berlin, where I built some massive raised flower beds as well as a huge greenhouse. <span class="comment">(I think at some point in time I have been the youngest Kleingärtner in the district Marzahn-Hellersdorf...)</span></p>
    </div>
    <div class="heading-with-short-description">
     <b>K-pop</b>
     <p>If you overlook the dystopian circumstances of its production, K-Pop is probably the best music for mathematicians... By the way, do you have a moment to talk about our Lord and Saviour, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TWICE/featured" class="external-link">TWICE</a>?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="heading-with-short-description">
     <b>Language Learning</b>
     <p>I like studying (the grammars of) different languages.</p>
